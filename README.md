# Discovery

Discovery is a simple node script aimed at getting specific `Meteor` informations on critical elements (such as collections, methods, allow/deny rules) in order to help the creator of the Meteor app to secure his code.

> Disclaimer: it relies on promises and is heavily under construction. Anyone facing the same issues or questions is of course welcome to contribute.
